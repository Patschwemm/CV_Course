Sheet 1:

    1. Really clever implementation of integral image. Forgot to take mean though in the results, both for sum and time
    4. 3 sigma is only half width, so kernel size is 2 * half width, hence you have higher difference with Gaussian Blur from opencv

Sheet 2:
    1. Kernel size of 7x7 corresponds to height = width = 7, not 49
    4. Image blending mask is grayscale, i.e. min=0, max=255, so instead of (1 - GR), it should be (255 - GR), the 1 in slides is assuming a binary mask.
       Ensure that data is of signed type before taking differences, in Laplacian Pyramid construction
       
Sheet 3:
    3c. Normalize the pixel coordinates to same range as intensity, otherwise the pixel coordinates will dominate the kmeans algorithm
    4. Degree Matrix is wrong, it is the sum of all edge weights going out of a each node in the graph
       Computation of Graph Cut wrong - eigen decomposition of the Graph Laplacian is the right way
